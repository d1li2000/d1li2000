****ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zhiyong (David) Li from Vancouver, BC, Canada****

**About Me**

Iâ€™m an aspiring data analyst with a keen interest in uncovering novel insights from complex datasets. My love for sports drives many of my projects, as I enjoy applying data analytics to explore new perspectives in the world of athletics. Iâ€™m always eager to tackle challenging problems and contribute meaningful solutions.

**My Work**

I have worked on a variety of projects, including one where I used K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to redefine player positions in the NBA beyond the traditional five-position model.

Beyond sports, I have led projects that span across different industries, including a strategic initiative with DARI Motion, where we explored cross-industry motion tracking integrations and improved internal data accessibility. 

**What Iâ€™m Interested In**

Iâ€™m particularly interested in:

	â€¢	Sports analytics and using data to gain new insights into athletic performance and strategy.
	â€¢	Exploring the ethical implications of data analytics, especially in terms of privacy, fairness, and transparency.
	â€¢	Cloud analytics and how cloud computing can enhance business intelligence and data-driven decision-making.

**How to Reach Me**

Iâ€™m always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, collaborating on interesting projects, or simply discussing the latest in data science and analytics. Feel free to reach out to me at:
